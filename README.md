## Overview
This project utilizes machine learning models to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not based on various features such as age, gender, class, and more.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the models is provided by Kaggle. It includes information about passengers, such as age, gender, ticket class, and whether they survived or not.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/AminHeidariSardabi/titanic.git
   cd titanic

Install the required dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the data/ directory.

## Usage:
Open file main.ipynb and run it

## Models:
The following machine learning models are used in this project:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine
K-Nearest Neighbors
Gradient Boosting
AdaBoost
XGBoost

## Results:
The model with the best accuracy on the validation set is selected as the final model. The predictions are saved to submission.csv for submission to Kaggle or further analysis.
